# Day 7 Completion Report - Dashboard Overview

## Date: 2025-09-19

## Overview
Successfully implemented the main dashboard with UBZI visualization, real-time data updates, and comprehensive monitoring features as outlined in the implementation plan.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependencies Installation
- ✅ Installed **recharts** for data visualization
- ✅ Installed **SWR** for efficient data fetching and caching

### 2. Core Components Created

#### UBZI Gauge Component (`app/components/UBZIGauge.tsx`)
- Circular gauge visualization showing 0-100 UBZI score
- Color-coded zones:
  - Red: Score < 40 (Low)
  - Yellow: Score 40-70 (Moderate)
  - Green: Score > 70 (Good)
- Three size variants (small, medium, large)
- Animated transitions for value changes
- Trend indicators showing percentage change

#### Trend Chart Component (`app/components/TrendChart.tsx`)
- Line/Area chart for historical data visualization
- Time range toggles: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days
- Cohort comparison overlay
- Responsive design with custom tooltips
- Statistical summary (current, average, change)
- Threshold indicators at 40 and 70

#### Alert Feed Component (`app/components/AlertFeed.tsx`)
- Real-time alert display with auto-refresh
- Severity indicators (critical, warning, info)
- Time-ago formatting for timestamps
- Alert resolution status tracking
- Empty state handling
- Maximum 10 alerts with scroll overflow

#### Error Boundary Component (`app/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Graceful error handling for component failures
- Fallback UI with retry functionality
- Development mode stack traces
- Customizable error callbacks

### 3. Data Fetching Infrastructure

#### SWR Hooks Created
- `app/hooks/useAggregations.ts`: System metrics and historical data
- `app/hooks/useAlerts.ts`: Alert management with counts

#### Features:
- 15-second refresh interval
- Automatic retry on failure
- Focus/reconnect revalidation
- Optimistic updates support
- Request deduplication

### 4. API Routes

#### Aggregations API (`app/api/aggregations/route.ts`)
- Enhanced with 90 days of historical data
- Cohort performance metrics
- System UBZI calculations
- Trend data generation

#### Alerts API (`app/api/alerts/route.ts`)
- Mock alert generation with various severities
- Alert counts by category
- Timestamp and resolution tracking
- Metric threshold data

### 5. Dashboard Page Updates

#### Enhanced Dashboard (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **System Overview Cards**:
  - System UBZI with trend indicator
  - Total Residents count
  - Active Alerts with severity color coding
  - Overall trend status

- **Main Visualizations**:
  - UBZI Score Trends (area chart with cohort comparison)
  - System Health gauge display
  - Cohort Performance cards with mini gauges
  - Real-time Alert Feed

- **Loading States**:
  - Skeleton screens during data fetch
  - Smooth transitions
  - Error state handling

- **Responsive Layout**:
  - Mobile-first design
  - Grid-based responsive layout
  - Proper spacing and alignment

## Technical Achievements

### Performance Optimizations
- SWR caching reduces API calls
- Component-level error boundaries prevent full app crashes
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Optimized chart rendering with Recharts

### User Experience Enhancements
- Loading skeletons for perceived performance
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Interactive charts with hover states
- Clear visual indicators for system status

### Code Quality
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Modular component architecture
- Reusable hooks for data fetching
- Consistent error handling patterns
